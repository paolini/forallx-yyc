For each argument, write a symbolization key and symbolize all of the sentences of the argument in TFL.
\begin{compactlist}
\item If Dorothy plays the piano in the morning, then Roger wakes up cranky. Dorothy plays piano in the morning unless she is distracted. So if Roger does not wake up cranky, then Dorothy must be distracted.

\problempart
For each argument, write a symbolization key and translate the argument as well as possible into TFL. The part of the passage in italics is there to provide context for the argument, and doesn't need to be symbolized.
\begin{compactlist}
\item It is going to rain soon. I know because my leg is hurting, and my leg hurts if it's going to rain.

\item  \emph{Spider-man tries to figure out the bad guy's plan.} If Doctor Octopus gets the uranium, he will blackmail the city. I am certain of this because if Doctor Octopus gets the uranium, he can make a dirty bomb, and if he can make a dirty bomb, he will blackmail the city.

\item \emph{A westerner tries to predict the policies of the Chinese government.} If the Chinese government cannot solve the water shortages in Beijing, they will have to move the capital. They don't want to move the capital. Therefore they must solve the water shortage. But the only way to solve the water shortage is to divert almost all the water from the Yangzi river northward. Therefore the Chinese government will go with the project to divert water from the south to the north.       

\end{compactlist}

\problempart
We symbolized an \emph{exclusive or} using `$\eor$', `$\eand$', and `$\enot$'. How could you symbolize an \emph{exclusive or} using only two connectives? Is there any way to symbolize an \emph{exclusive or} using only one connective?
\\\myanswer{For two connectives, we could offer any of the following: 
\begin{center}
$\enot(\metav{A} \eiff \metav{B})$\\
$(\enot\metav{A} \eiff \metav{B})$\\
$(\enot (\enot \metav{A} \eand \enot \metav{B}) \eand \enot (\metav{A} \eand \metav{B}))$
\end{center}
But if we wanted to symbolize it using only one connective, we would have to introduce a new primitive connective.

\item $J_{374} \eor \enot J_{374}$\hfill \myanswer{(a) no (b) yes}

\item $(F \eiff \enot D \eif J) \eor (C \eand D)$\hfill \myanswer{(a) no (b) no}
\end{compactlist}

\problempart
Are there any sentences of TFL that contain no atomic sentences? Explain your answer.
\\\myanswer{No. Atomic sentences contain atomic sentences (trivially). And every more complicated sentence is built up out of less complicated sentences, that were in turn built out of less complicated sentences, \ldots, that were ultimately built out of atomic sentences.}\\


\problempart
What is the scope of each connective in the sentence
$$\bigl[(H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)\bigr] \eand (J \eor K)$$
\myanswer{The scope of the left-most instance of `$\eif$' is `$(H \eif I)$'.\\
The scope of the right-most instance of `$\eif$' is `$(I \eif H)$'.\\
The scope of the left-most instance of `$\eor$ is `$\bigl[(H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)\bigr]$'\\
The scope of the right-most instance of `$\eor$' is `$(J \eor K)$'\\
The scope of the conjunction is the entire sentence; so conjunction is the main logical connective of the sentence.}
